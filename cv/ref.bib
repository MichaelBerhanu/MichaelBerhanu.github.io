    abstract = {Manuscript in French. In electrically conducting fluids, the electromagnetic field is coupled with the fluid motion byinduction effects. We studied different magnétohydrodynamic phenomena, using two experiments involving turbulent flows of liquid metal. The first mid-sized uses gallium. The second, using sodium, is conducted within the VKS (Von Karman Sodium) collaboration. It has led to the observation of the dynamo effect, namely converting a part of the kinetic energy of the fluid into magnetic energy. We have shown that, depending on forcing conditions, a statistically stationary dynamo, or dynamical regimes of magnetic field can be generated. In particular, polarity reversals similar to those of Earth's magnetic field were observed. Meanwhile, experiment with Gallium has been developed to study the effects of electromagnetic induction by turbulent flows in a more homogeneous and isotropic configuration than in the VKS experiment. Using data from these two experiments, we studied the advection of magnetic field by a turbulent flow and the induced fluctuations. The development of probes measuring electrical potential difference allowed us to further highlight the magnetic braking of a turbulent flow of Gallium by Lorentz force. This mechanism is involved in the saturation of the dynamo instability.},

Here, we report the emergence in the laboratory of a streamwise dissolution pattern at the surface of an initially flat soluble material, inclined and subjected to a thin runoff water flow. Nearly parallel grooves about 1 mm wide and directed along the main slope spontaneously form. Their width and depth increase continuously with time until their crests emerge and channelize the flow. Our observations may constitute the early stage of the patterns observed in the field.},

In addition to the downscale transfer usually reported in gravity-wave turbulence, an upscale transfer is observed, interpreted as the inverse cascade of weak turbulence theory. A steady state is achieved when the inverse cascade reaches a scale in between the forcing wavelength and the basin size, but far from the latter. This inverse cascade saturation, which depends on the wave steepness, is probably due to the emergence of nonlinear dissipative structures such as sharp-crested waves.},

    abstract = {The dissolution of a body into quiescent water leads to density stratifications at the interfaces that drive buoyant flows. Where the stratification is unstable, the flow destabilizes into convective solute plumes. By analogy with the Rayleigh-Bénard instability where concentration replaces temperature, this phenomenon is known as the solutal Rayleigh-Bénard instability. Here we report experiments of the dissolution of inclined rectangular blocks made of salt, caramel, or plaster in aqueous solutions of various concentrations. The solute flows along the block while forming plumes before they detach and sink. This flow along the block organizes the emission of plumes within longitudinal parallel stripes with a well-defined millimeter-scale wavelength. The instability of the flow reflects on the concentration field in the boundary layer, which engraves longitudinal grooves onto the block. These grooves interact with the flow and turn into a paving of three-dimensional, cuplike patterns that grow in size and propagate upstream. These bedforms are reminiscent of the scallop bedforms observed on the walls of cave or icebergs. Whereas the block interface is highly dynamical and evolves through time, it remains flat on the global scale and recedes at a stationary rate. We derive scaling laws for the receding velocity and the pattern genesis at the inclined interface that are based on a concentration boundary layerof constant thickness, which is controlled by the flow instability but where neither the patterns nor the flow along the block play any role. We apply these results to the formation of sublimation patterns.},

    abstract = {The dissolution of minerals into water becomes significant in geomorphology whenthe erosion rate is controlled by the hydrodynamic transport of the solute. Even in the absence of an external flow, dissolution itself can induce a convective flow due to theaction of gravity. Here we perform a study of the physics of solutal convection induced by dissolution. We simulate numerically the hydrodynamics and the solute transport in atwo-dimensional geometry, corresponding to the case where a soluble body is suddenlyimmersed in a quiescent solvent. We identify three regimes. At a short timescale, a concentrated boundary layer grows by diffusion at the interface. After a finite onset time,the thickness and the density reach critical values, which starts the destabilization ofthe boundary layer. Finally, the destabilization is such that we observe the emission ofintermittent plumes. This last regime is quasistationary: The structure of the boundary layer and the erosion rate fluctuate around constant values. Assuming that the destabilization ofthe boundary layer occurs at a specific value of the solutal Rayleigh number, we derivescaling laws for both fast and slow dissolution kinetics. Our simulations confirm thisscenario by validating the scaling laws for both onset and the quasistationary regime. We find a constant value of the Rayleigh number during the quasistationary regime, showing that the structure of the boundary layer is well controlled by the solutal convection. Weapply the scaling laws previously established to the case of real dissolving minerals. We predict the typical dissolution rate in the presence of solutal convection. Our results suggest that solutal convection could occur in more natural situations than expected. Even for minerals with a quite low saturation concentration, the erosion rate would increase as the dissolution would be controlled by the hydrodynamics.},

Rev.E 93, 043110 (2016) ], we characterized experimentally the generation by this mechanism of a daughter wave,whose amplitude saturates due to the viscous dissipation. Here, we show experimentally the generation of a daughter wave verifying the resonant conditions, but not the dispersionrelation. By modeling the response of the free surface at the lowest nonlinear order, we explain this observation as a forced interaction. The bandwidth of the linear transfer function of the free surface is indeed increased by the significant viscous dissipation. The observation of free surface excitations not following the linear dispersion relation then becomes possible. This forced three-wave interaction mechanism could have important consequences for wave turbulence in experimental or natural systems with non negligible dissipation.},

    abstract = {The uplift of an initially flat elastic membrane by an upward viscous flow is investigated experimentally. The deformed shape of the membrane results from a balance between the flow pressure, the elastic response of the membrane, and the fluid weight. This last effect becomes non-negligible for a large enough deformed area. The usual theoretical approach supposes the presence of a prewetting film regularizing the viscous stresses according to Lister et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 154501 (2013)]. Nevertheless, in our experiments without prewetting films, the measurements are correctly described with this theory in the elastic regime. Microscale roughness of membranes could introduce an equivalent characteristic scale in the problem. An alternative explanation could be provided by the appearance of a fluid lag filled with gas, for which a new theoretical framework has been recently proposed by Ball and Neufeld [Phys. Rev. Fluids 3, 074101 (2018)]. We compare the two approaches and find that both describe reasonably our experiments. However, consistency tests of both models show that the prewetting film model is more appropriate to describe our experimental data.},

We observe the emergence of nonlinear localized structures that evolve on a stochastic wave background. Such a coexistence is expected by the integrable turbulence theory for the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE), and we report the first experimental observation in the context of hydrodynamic waves. We characterize the formation, the properties, and the dynamics of these nonlinear coherent structures (solitons and extreme events) within the incoherent wave background. The extreme events result from the strong steepening of wave train fronts, and their emergence occurs after roughly one nonlinear length scale of propagation (estimated from the NLSE). Solitons arise when nonlinearity and dispersion are weak, and of the same order of magnitude as expected from the NLSE. We characterize the statistical properties of this state. The number of solitons and extreme events is found to increase all along the propagation, the wave-field distribution has a heavy tail, and the surface elevation spectrum is found to scale as a frequency power law with an exponent −4.5±0.5. Most of these observations are compatible with the integrable turbulence theory for the NLSE although some deviations (e.g., power-law spectrum, asymmetrical extreme events) result from effects proper to hydrodynamic waves.},

Capillary waves are produced here by gravity waves from nonlinear wave interactions. Using a spatio-temporal measurement of the free surface, we characterize statistically the random regimes of capillary waves in the spatial and temporal Fourier spaces. For a significant wave steepness (0.2–0.3), power-law spectra are observed both in space and time, defining a turbulent regime of capillary waves transferring energy from the large scale to the small scale. Analysis of temporal fluctuations of the spatial spectrum demonstrates that the capillary power-law spectra result from the temporal averaging over intermittent and strong nonlinear events transferring energy to the small scale in a fast time scale, when capillary wave trains are generated in a way similar to the parasitic capillary wave generation mechanism. The frequency and wavenumber power-law exponents of the wave spectra are found to be in agreement with those of the weakly nonlinear wave turbulence theory. However, the energy flux is not constant through the scales and the wave spectrum scaling with this flux is not in good agreement with wave turbulence theory. These results suggest that theoretical developments beyond the classic wave turbulence theory are necessary to describe the dynamics and statistics of capillary waves in a natural environment. In particular, in the presence of broad-scale viscous dissipation and strong nonlinearity, the role of non-local and non-resonant interactions should be reconsidered.},

We consider two different configurations: a one-dimensional (1D) monochromatic wave forcing, and a two-dimensional (2D) forcing with bichromatic waves satisfying resonant-wave interaction conditions. For the 1D forcing, we find a discrete wave-energy spectrum dominated at high frequencies by bound waves whose amplitudes decrease as a power law of the frequency. Bound waves (e.g., to the carrier) are harmonics superimposed on the carrier wave propagating with the same phase velocity as the one of the carrier. When a narrow frequency random modulation is applied to this carrier, the high-frequency part of the wave-energy spectrum becomes continuous with the same frequency-power law. Similar results are found for the 2D forcing when a random modulation is also applied to both carrier waves. Our results thus show that all these nonlinear gravity wave spectra are dominated at high frequencies by the presence of bound waves, even in the configuration where resonant interactions occur. Moreover, in all these configurations, the power-law exponent of the spectrum is found to depend on the forcing amplitude with the same trend as the one found in previous gravity wave turbulence experiments. Such a set of bound waves may thus explain this dependence that was previously poorly understood.},

Furthermore, by focusing on the stationary regime and by taking into account viscous dissipation, we directly estimate the growth rate of the resonant mode.

The roles of the basin boundary conditions (absorbing or reflecting) and of the forcing properties are investigated. To that purpose, an absorbing sloping beach opposite the wavemaker can be replaced by a reflecting vertical wall. We observe that the wave field properties depend strongly on these boundary conditions. A quasi-one-dimensional field of nonlinear waves propagates towards the beach, where they are damped whereas a more multidirectional wave field is observed with the wall. In both cases, the wave spectrum scales as a frequency power law with an exponent that increases continuously with the forcing amplitude up to a value close to −4 . The physical mechanisms involved most likely differ with the boundary condition used, but cannot be easily discriminated with only temporal measurements. We also studied freely decaying gravity wave turbulence in the closed basin. No self-similar decay of the spectrum is observed, whereas its Fourier modes decay first as a time power law due to nonlinear mechanisms, and then exponentially due to linear viscous damping. We estimate the linear, nonlinear and dissipative time scales to test the time scale separation that highlights the important role of a large-scale Fourier mode. By estimation of the mean energy flux from the initial decay of wave energy, the Kolmogorov–Zakharov constant of the weak turbulence theory is evaluated and found to be compatible with a recently obtained theoretical value.},

    abstract = {We report laboratory experiments on surface waves generated in a uniform fluid layer whose bottom undergoes an upward motion. Simultaneous measurements of the free-surface deformation and the fluid velocity field are focused on the role of the bottom kinematics (i.e. its spatio-temporal features) in wave generation. We observe that the fluid layer transfers bottom motion to the free surface as a temporal high-pass filter coupled with a spatial low-pass filter. Both filter effects are often neglected in tsunami warning systems, particularly in real-time forecast. Our results display good agreement with a prevailing linear theory without any parameter fitting. Based on our experimental findings, we provide a simple theoretical approach for modelling the rapid kinematics limit that is applicable even for initially non-flat bottoms: this may be a key step for more realistic varying bathymetry in tsunami scenarios.},

    abstract = {This work presents direct numerical simulations of capillary wave turbulence solving the full three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations of a two-phase flow. When the interface is locally forced at large scales, a statistical stationary state appears after few forcing periods. Smaller wave scales are generated by nonlinear interactions, and the wave height spectrum is found to obey a power law in both wave number and frequency, in good agreement with weak turbulence theory. By estimation of the mean energy flux from the dissipated power, the Kolmogorov-Zakharov constant is evaluated and found to be compatible with the exact theoretical value. The time scale separation between linear, nonlinear interaction, and dissipative times is also observed. These numerical results confirm the validity of the weak turbulence approach to quantify out-of equilibrium wave statistics.},

    abstract = {A two-dimensional system of particles with tunable repulsive interactions is experimentally investigated. Soft ferromagnetic particles are placed on a vibrating rough plate and vertically confined, so that they perform a horizontal Brownian motion in a cell. When immersed in an external vertical magnetic field, the particles become magnetised and thus interact according to a dipolar repulsive law. As the amplitude of the magnetic field is increased, magnetic repulsion raises and the rate of inelastic collisions decreases. Studying notably the pair correlation function and the particle velocity distributions, we show that the typical properties of such a dissipative out-of-equilibrium granular gas are progressively lost, to approach those expected for a usual gas at thermodynamic equilibrium. For stronger interaction strengths, the system gradually solidifies towards a hexagonal crystal. This new setup could consequently be used as a model experimental system for out-of-equilibrium statistical physics, in which the distance to the quasi-elastic limit can be accurately controlled.},

Here we propose an experimental estimation of the energy flux at every scale of the capillary cascade. The latter is found to be nonconstant through the scales. For fluids of low enough viscosity, we found that both capillary spectrum scalings with the frequency and the newly defined mean energy flux are in good agreement with wave turbulence theory.

The swimming stroke of the sheet is a prescribed propagating wave that travels along the sheet in the azimuthal direction. The measurements are performed with the sheet immersed in a fluid inside a cylindrical tank under torque-free conditions. Swimming speeds in the Newtonian case are found to be consistent with calculations using the Stokes equation. A faster swimming speed is found in a viscoelastic fluid that has a viscosity independent of shear rate. By contrast, a slower swimming speed is found with more complex shear-thinning viscoelastic fluids which have multiple relaxation time scales as well. These results are compared with calculations with Oldroyd-B fluids which find a decreasing swimming speed with Deborah number given by the product of the fluid elastic relaxation time scale and the driving frequency.},

Our experimental apparatus consists of a wide rectangular box filled with glass beads with a narrow opening in one of the side walls from which eroded grains can exit. Quantitative data on the shape of the pattern and erosion dynamics are obtained with a laser-aided topography technique. We show that the spatial distribution of the source of groundwater can significantly impact the shape of observed patterns. An elongated channel is observed to grow upstream when groundwater is injected at a boundary adjacent to a reservoir held at constant height. An amphitheater (semicircular) shape is observed when uniform rainfall infiltrates the granular bed to maintain a water table. Bifurcations are observed as the channels grow in response to the groundwater. We further find that the channels grow by discrete avalanches as the height of the granular bed is increased above the capillary rise, causing the deeper channels to have rougher fronts. The spatiotemporal distribution of avalanches increase with bed height when partial saturation of the bed leads to cohesion between grains. However, the overall shape of the channels is observed to remain unaffected indicating that seepage erosion is robust to perturbation of the erosion front.},

We show that the measured capillary forces between two spheres as a function of distance can be described by expressions obtained using the Nicolson approximation at low Bond numbers for far greater particle sizes than previously assumed. We find that viscous hydrodynamic interactions between the spheres needs to be included to describe the dynamics close to contact. We then consider the aggregates formed when a third sphere is added after the initial two spheres are already in contact. In this case, we find that linear superposition of capillary forces describes the observed approach qualitatively but not quantitatively. Further, we observe an angular dependence of the structure due to a rapid decrease of capillary force with distance of separation, which has a tendency to align the particles before contact. When the three particles come into contact, they may preserve their shape or rearrange to form an equilateral triangle cluster—the lowest-energy state—depending on the competition between attraction between particles and friction. Using these observations, we demonstrate that a linear particle chain can be built from frictional particles with capillary attraction.},

For some values of the asymmetry parameter θ = (F 1–F 2)/(F 1+F 2), time dependent dynamo regimes develop. They are observed either when the forcing is increased for a given value of asymmetry, or when the amount of asymmetry is varied at sufficiently high forcing.

These transitions can be interpreted using a low dimensional model based on the interactions of two dynamo modes. },

We present an experimental study of the two regimes and study in detail the region of bistability that we understand in terms of dynamical system theory. Despite the very turbulent nature of the flow, the bifurcations of the magnetic field are correctly described by a low-dimensional model.

The flow structures develop some anisotropy but do not become bidimensional. From a dynamical viewpoint, the damping first occurs homogeneously over the whole spectrum of frequencies. For larger values of N, a very strong additional damping occurs at the highest frequencies. However, the injected mechanical power remains independent of the applied magnetic field. The simultaneous measurement of induced magnetic field and electrical potential differences shows a very weak correlation between magnetic field and velocity fluctuations. The observed reduction in the fluctuations is in agreement with a previously proposed mechanism for the saturation of turbulent dynamos and with the order of magnitude of the Von Kármán sodium dynamo magnetic field},

As sloshing can be observed only in 0g domain where capillary forces start dominating the inertial effect, satellite design is mainly based on more or less complex models. Because of the unavailability or inaccessibility of experimental data, these models are often not thoroughly validated.
FLUIDICS (FLUId DynamICs in Space) was a part of the PROXIMA project development during the flight of Thomas Pesquet. The development has been done in close cooperation and funding of Airbus and CNES. The main goal of the experiment is to enable model validation through correlation with measurements. FLUIDICS apparatus is built as a slow rate centrifuge that can establish specific controlled micro-gravity conditions or dedicated excitations on a sample tank. Two cameras offer video recording capability and a dedicated sensor monitors the forces generated by the fluid motion.
For the sloshing part, experimental motion profiles implements several acceleration and speed representative of typical satellite slew manoeuvres and tranquilization phases. Two tanks will be used to study the impact of the filling ratio, representative of the depletion during the satellite lifetime.
The Wave turbulence part uses periodic excitation of small amplitude at different levels and frequencies.
Fluidics experiment is still on-board of Columbus ready to be used in the next few months. Innovative perspectives are also foreseen to study new tanks design mitigating the sloshing impact that can be used on the same FLUIDICS setup.},
